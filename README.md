# Daily Planner

## Description

I have created a daily planner to save events at hourly intervals from 9am - 5pm. The planner colour codes the time blocks depending on whether they have passed, are currently occuring or are yet to occur. Events can be saved and the page can be closed. When reloaded, the day's events will still display. Only one day schedule is presented.
